# Galley import pluginfor OJS 3.2

This plugin is for mass importing Galley files to articles that have been already published in OJS.

The plugin can only be used from the command line.

`php importExport.php GalleyImportExportPlugin pathToDataFile pathToGalleyFileFolder contextPath importingUsername`

The data file should have a line for each galley to be imported. The structure of a single line with # being the delimeter is:

`articleTitle#issuePublishedDate#file#fileLabel#fileLocale`

See the example data file in the repository.

The plugin will read the datafile and will try to search a matching article title within an issue with the matching published date. The search is limited to the context given in the call usint a context path.

If a match is found, the plugin will make sure there is no more than one match and no prior galley is added to the article. If these checks are ok, a galley is created using the file mentioned in the datafile. Otherwise, the script will print out errors or notices concerning failed searches.
